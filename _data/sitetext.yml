        desc: "Piero Barone earned his PhD from the University of Perugia, Italy, focusing on the cytological and molecular characterization of a female sterility trait in alfalfa and during an exchange program with the University of Georgia, he developed transgenic alfalfa lines for aluminum tolerance. In 2003, he joined the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, as a Postdoctoral Research Associate, working on a novel selection system for nuclear and plastid transformation. In 2008, he became a Research Scientist at Chromatin, designing and validating selection and transgenic event regeneration protocols for corn, sorghum, and sugarcane. In 2014, he joined Dow AgroSciences' Monocot Transformation Team, focusing on maize trait discovery projects and managing transformation programs using the Zinc Finger gene targeting tool. In 2018, Piero joined Corteva Agriscience in Johnston, where he is currently the Capability Leader of the Genome Editing group in the Biotechnology Function of Corteva R&D. He is currently the President of the Society for In Vitro Biology."

He obtained his undergraduate degree in the Philippines in 1984 and his Ph.D. degree in plant breeding from the University of Illinois in 1988. Dr. Bernardo developed the widely used genomic best linear unbiased prediction or GBLUP procedure in 1994, and most of his work has focused on marker-assisted breeding. Dr. Bernardo is director of the Plant Breeding Center at Minnesota, has written two textbooks, and teaches graduate courses in plant breeding and in professional skills for scientists as well as a freshman seminar course on coffee."

Dr. Sistla’s scholarship focuses on understanding how land systems respond to environmental and management changes and how these responses can feed back to affect critical environmental processes like carbon sequestration. She received her PhD from UCSB focusing on terrestrial biogeochemical responses to warming in arctic systems and was a NOAA Climate and Global Change postdoctoral fellow at UC Irvine. Dr. Sistla joined Cal Poly in 2019 where her lab's research grew to include the study of the extent and consequences of plastic pollution in agricultural systems—a shift that reflects the pernicious expansion of plasticulture in CA and across the world."

          We are thrilled to bring together the UC Davis Plant Sciences community for this year's symposium! <br><br>
          Come to hear from speakers from across a diverse range of plant-related disciplines, 
          network with academic and industry professionals, and enjoy a poster session and reception. 
          The event will also be live-streamed to share fantastic research with attendees near and far.<br><br>
          <b>In-Person Attendance Information</b>
          <br>The symposium will be hosted at the UC Davis Conference Center (550 Alumni Ln, Davis, CA 95616). 
          The doors will open at 8 AM, and the event will conclude at 7 PM. Upon arrival, please proceed to the lobby 
          to check in and receive your name badge. If you are presenting a 
          poster, please mount your poster in Ballroom A allocated for the poster session. Lunch and light 
          refreshments will be served on-site. Please be prepared to show proof of age when checking in if you would
